# RetroPie Game Saves

(Note) Please sit tight as I am uploading all the game saves I have and will update with what each one has here when I try them out

Here are my own personal retro video game saves. I put a lot of time into many of these just so your RetroPie gaming experience is maximized.

Please do not worry about the RPG's because I make sure that each RPG game save I have, and will, upload, will be the best and making sure that everyone is at level 99.

RPG Notice: Super Mario RPG has each of the characters put the majority of the stats is what they go towards. Mario and Geno have had HP chosen 3 times, but was mainly for the Physical/Magic standings.

Mario \& Geno: Physical/Magic - Peach: HP/Magic - Bowser: Physical - Mallow: HP/Magic/Physical
